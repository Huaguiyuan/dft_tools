# Hypothetical input file with extra parameters for Wannier90Converter  

# if verbosity is 2 then warning massages are printed
verbosity  = 1 ! default value is also 2,
# if the user value of verbosity is different than 2 this attribute will be set to "None" in Wannier90Converter

# num_zero = 0.1 (this is in the comment section )
 
num_zero = 0.001 ! default value  is 0.0001 in same cases it should be increased 


! non_standard_corr_shells  should be set to true  if shells like p, s usually considered non correlated should be
#  treated as correlated
# Please notice the case letter. Here is true not True like it would be in Python.
non_standard_corr_shells = true
! This is because it is read using json module. Java notation for boolean variables has to be used here.
