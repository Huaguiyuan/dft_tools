Description of tests:


1) Test for validity of constructing shells from *.win file
   
   Files: proj.win, test_proj.py

   Description:
   In proj.win file hypothetical projection is stored. In this test it is verified whether 
   wannier_converter  can properly transform block:

   begin projections
   -----------------
   -----------------
  
   end projections

   into shells (sort parameter is evaluate later basing on data from Hr file). 
   "------"  symbolizes valid entry with projection (or projections) written in the format accepted by wannier90. 

   Features tested within this benchmark:   

      * Various possible formats of projections are used (chapter 3 from Wannier90 User Guide). 

      * It is checked if comment sections are correctly detected. 

      * It is checked if lower/upper cases in names of projections are treated properly 
        (should be case letter invariance) 

2) Test for validity of reading parameters from *.win file

   Files: LaTiO3.win, test_win.py

   Description:
   In this benchmark a realistic case of LaTiO3 with Ti t2g and  O2p states in local Hamiltonian is considered. 
   It is verified if data is read properly from LaTiO3.win file (all content of win file is provided here directly from wannier90 calculations).
   
   Features tested within this benchmark:
   
       * It is checked if lower/upper cases letters are treated as the same (Fortran style)


       * Various ways of keywords are used:

               num_wann 4
              
               num_wann = 4

               num_wann : 4    
 
          and it is checked if in all cases the keyword is read properly.

       * It is tested if attributes of wannier converter are extracted properly from data which was read from *.win file

3) Test DMFT calculation correctness in case of SrVO3 (only t2g orbitals included in calculations)

   Files: SrVO3.win, SrVO3_hr.dat, SrVO3.chk.fmt, wannier_converter_dft_dmft_cthyb.py
 
   Description:

   SrVO3.win stores input for wannier90. SrVO3_hr.dat is one of output files of wannier90. 
   SrVO3_hr.dat stores a real representation of local Hamiltonian expressed in MLWFs. 
   SrVO3.chk.fmt is a file which stores  formatted (machine independent) data. SrVO3.chk.fmt stores 
   information required to restart the calculation of wannier90 or enter the plotting phase which is performed by wannier90. 
   In particular it stores U matrices (called projectors in TRIQS). wannier_converter_dft_dmft_cthyb.py is a modified 
   version of  dft_dmft_cthyb.py from core SumKDFT (only few lines have been changed to keep  maximum  compatibility).
   In order to optimize space resulting SrVO3.h5 is not included in the repository.
   SrVO3.h5 can easily be created by running this benchmark.
   
   Features tested within this benchmark:

      (*) Test if rerun is  correct has been done
