DFT Tools
=========

This application is aimed at DMFT calculations with
realistic band structure calculations.
A priori TRIQS can be connected to various realistic band structure codes.
In this release, we provide the dft_tools extension module which contains an
interface to the 

 * `WIEN2K package <http://www.wien2k.at>`_.
 * A general Hamiltonian H(k)
 * FLEUR (in progress..)
 * VASP? (in progress..)
 * Wannier90? (in progress..)
